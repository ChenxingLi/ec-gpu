/**
 * This code computes the Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM) operation, where the input is the dot product
 * of elliptic curve points and a vector of scalars for the elliptic curve. Each scalar is treated as a large integer,
 * and the product of a scalar and an elliptic curve point is equivalent to repeatedly adding the elliptic curve point
 * that many times.
 *
 * The trivial approach to compute the scalar multiplication of an elliptic curve point and a large integer is to
 * repeatedly double the elliptic curve point P to obtain P, 2P, 4P, ..., perform a binary expansion of the integer,
 * and then combine the doubling results with the binary expansion results.
 *
 * MSM computation has an optimization. For example, to calculate 5P + 7Q, we can transform it into (4P + P) + (4Q + 2Q + Q),
 * and then combine the results based on powers of two to get 4(Q+P) + 2P + (P+Q). Here, 4, 2, 1 are viewed as three buckets,
 * and Q+P, P, P+Q are the contents of the three buckets, respectively. Each bucket accumulates elliptic curve points that 
 * need to be multiplied by the same scalar integer. After traversing the entire input vector, it performs a 
 * single scalar multiplication, avoiding the overhead of computing separate scalar multiplications for each point.
 *
 * There are multiple ways to set up the buckets. One approach is to divide the binary representation of the large integers into several windows,
 * and each non-zero binary value within a window corresponds to a bucket. For example, when the large integer is 256 bits and the window size is 8,
 * it can be divided into 32 windows, and each window has 255 buckets.
 *
 * One optimization technique is to treat the numbers within a window as signed integers called WNAF (windowed non-adjacent form). 
 * For example, with a 4-bit window, 93 can be represented as 5 × 16 + 13, but also 6 × 16 - 3. For -3 × P, the negated point -P is 
 * placed into the bucket corresponding to 3. This optimization is suitable when negating an elliptic curve point is cheap, and it can 
 * save approximately half of the bucket.
 *
 * This code takes a row of large integer vectors and several rows of elliptic curve points as input. All the rows share the same length.
 * The code divides each row into several chunks based on the input parameters and computes the MSM for each chunk separately. When there 
 * are m rows and each row is divided into k chunks, there will be m * k independent MSM tasks.
 *
 * For each MSM task, each bucket window corresponds to a thread, the threads belongs to the same task should be in the same cuda block. 
 * Each thread traverses each large integer scalar within the task range and maintains the buckets of its cluster. When all the data has
 * been traversed, the points in the buckets are multiplied by the corresponding bucket values and added together.
