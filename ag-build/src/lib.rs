//! CUDA/OpenCL code generator for finite-field arithmetic over prime fields and elliptic curve
//! arithmetic constructed with Rust.
//!
//! There is also support for Fast Fourier Transform and Multiexponentiation.
//!
//! This crate usually creates GPU kernels at compile-time. CUDA generates a [fatbin], which OpenCL only generates the source code, which is then compiled at run-time.
//!
//! In order to make things easier to use, there are helper functions available. You would put some code into `build.rs`, that generates the kernels, and some code into your library which then consumes those generated kernels. The kernels will be directly embedded into your program/library. If something goes wrong, you will get an error at compile-time.
//!
//! In this example we will make use of the FFT functionality. Add to your `build.rs`:
//!
//!
//! The `ag_build::generate()` takes care of the actual code generation/compilation. It will automatically create a CUDA and/or OpenCL kernel. It will define two environment variables, which are meant for internal use. `_EC_GPU_CUDA_KERNEL_FATBIN` that points to the compiled CUDA kernel, and `_EC_GPU_OPENCL_KERNEL_SOURCE` that points to the generated OpenCL source.

//! Feature flags
//! -------------
//!
//! CUDA and OpenCL are supprted, each be enabled with the `cuda` and `opencl` [feature flags].
